Hi Humans!

djzenisek here and I'm trying to figure out how Git works. I'm not at all familiar with branches and commits, so take it easy on me.
Remember that time I made a submission to a repository by editing the master before building a branch and inviting comments? I remember. That was earlier today.
Maybe we'll look back on this day sometime in the near future and laugh.
